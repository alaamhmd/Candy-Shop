# Candy-Shop

This is a project to design a Candy Shop which follows following requirements:


1-Create a FlavorButton class. 

The Flavor class should have a constructor with input parameters a String for the flavor and a double for the cost. 

2-Have a String field in the class for the flavor and double field in the class for the cost.

3-Finally have an inner class that implements the ActionListener interface and add an object of the class . 

4-Similarly create a Topping class.

5-We first read flavors file,  for each flavor using the flavor and cost and add the Flavor object to an ArrayList<FlavorButton> object.

6-Do the same for the toppings. 

7-In addition we have an Item interface, a Cone class, a Flavor class, a Topping class and associated action classes 

8-we Make sure a cone is chosen first and if a cone is chosen, make sure a topping cannot be chosen.

9-At the end this displays the description and cost of the ice cream item in a nice format.

For example, something like:

Cone with a scoop of vanilla a scoop of chocolate

$1.50


Cone with a scoop of mango a scoop of chocolate a scoop of chocolate chip

$5.35
